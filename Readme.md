# 🚀 **Bug Detection & Code Optimization Suite**

Welcome to the **Bug Detection & Code Optimization Suite**! 🎉  
This powerful toolkit helps you **spot bugs** and **optimize Python code** — making your development workflow faster, cleaner, and way more efficient. Whether you're just starting out or you're a seasoned coder, this tool will **level up your coding game**!

## 🐞 **Bug Detection Magic: Catch the Culprits!**

### 🧠 **What It Does:**
The **Bug Detection** system uses **AI-powered predictions** to detect potential issues in your software. Whether it’s a **404 error** or a **runtime exception**, the system will tell you if your input describes a **bug**.

---

### ⚡ **How It Works:**
1. **Input:** Provide an error message or a description of the issue.
2. **Processing:** A pre-trained AI model analyzes the input using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
3. **Output:** Instantly get feedback — whether it's a *bug* or not.

---

### 🌟 **Example:**

**Input:**
```
User is unable to upload files larger than 2MB, even though the limit is set to 10MB.
```

**Output:**
```
Bug 🐛
```

> It's like having a personal bug detective! 😎

## ⚙ **Code Optimization: Supercharge Your Python Code**

### 🏎 **What It Does:**
**Code Optimization** improves your Python scripts for **better performance** and **cleaner structure**. It simplifies logic, removes redundant code, and enhances readability.

---

### 🔥 **How It Works:**
1. **Input:** Paste a Python code snippet.
2. **Optimization:** The system analyzes and applies smart optimization techniques.
3. **Output:** Get a **faster, cleaner** version of your code.

---

### ⚡ **Example:**

**Original Code:**
```python
def calc_sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for i in numbers:
        total += i
    return total
```

**Optimized Code:**
```python
def calc_sum(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)  # Optimized using Python's built-in sum function
```

🔧 **Changes Made:**
- Removed the unnecessary loop.
- Used Python’s built-in `sum()` function for better performance and readability.

# 🚀 **How to Use This Suite**

### 1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bug-detection-code-optimization.git
cd bug-detection-code-optimization
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs all required libraries to run Bug Detection and Code Optimization.

---

### 3. **Run Bug Detection**
```bash
python bug_detection.py
```
You'll be prompted to input an error description.

**Example Session:**
```bash
Enter text for bug detection: Error 404 displayed when trying to access the user profile page after login.
Prediction: Bug 🐛
```

---

### 4. **Run Code Optimization**
```bash
python optimize_code.py
```
You'll be asked to input your Python code.

**Example Session:**
```bash
Enter your Python code for optimization:
def calc_sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for i in numbers:
        total += i
    return total
```

**Output:**
```python
def calc_sum(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)
```
